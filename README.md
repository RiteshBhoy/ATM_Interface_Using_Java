# ATM Interface in Java

This is a simple **ATM Interface** implemented in Java. The program simulates an ATM system where users can authenticate using a PIN and perform transactions like **checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the system**.

## Features

- **PIN Authentication:** Users must enter the correct PIN to access the ATM.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Displays the current balance.
- **Deposit Money:** Allows users to add money to their account.
- **Withdraw Money:** Enables users to withdraw money if sufficient balance is available.
- **Exit Option:** Safely exits the application.
